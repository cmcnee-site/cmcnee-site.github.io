		<blockquote><p>So what's all this about?</p>
			<p>Well, I'm a writer and I wanted to make a digital comic. I foolishly thought that if I wrote a good story, then I would be able to find an artist to illustrate it. What I found out was, most artists think that writing is easy and that if they know what all the buttons do in Photoshop, then they are an artist. The vast majority of the "artists" who are willing to illustrate someone else's story are frankly, terrible. After viewing the glorified stick-figures in one fellow's portfolio, I asked him what he thought of Poser, to which he replied, "Poser is for posers." I thought, I'm a better artist than this guy, so Poser it is and poser I am. It has taken years to learn what I need to know, but not any longer than it took to learn how to write well. This is some of what I've learned.</p>
